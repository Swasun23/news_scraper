      'article_text': 'The brutal winter of discretionary spend cuts in the IT industry is likely over, but there is little evidence of a recovery in the flow business. Hence, we are on track for one of the weakest first quarters for at least 10 years. We expect the revenues of IT services companies to recover following a tepid 4QFY24 for the industry, as the ramp-up of large cost-takeout deals could drive growth for large-caps in a seasonally strong quarter. The situation, though slightly better, is eerily similar to what we witnessed in 1HFY24. We would be looking for signs of recovery in discretionary spending in the form of deal activities , which have been heavily skewed towards cost-takeout projects. However, any disappointment in 1QFY25 could again put pressure on 2Q. We believe mid-tier companies could continue to perform well, especially those with strong offerings in “pre-GenAI” spending, such as data engineering . We expect aggregate revenue/EBIT/PAT to grow by 3.2/5.2/6.1% respectively (all in INR terms) yoy for our coverage universe. Verticals such as BFS and Communications have been under pressure for the past 5-6 quarters; and while spending patterns remain largely unchanged, deal wins over the past couple of quarters should start accelerating in this quarter. This should offer some respite to growth rates for these verticals, especially for Infosys as the base becomes more favorable. Hi-tech, following a brief recovery, might face challenges, as spending on software moderates. We expect no changes in guidance/commentary from companies on FY25 revenue growth . The focus of the commentaries is likely to remain on demand pick-up in 2HFY25, indicating a more normalized FY26 spending environment. We expect revenue growth of Tier-I companies to be in the range of -0.5% to +2.0% QoQ in CC. Revenue of Tier-II players is expected to grow by -1.5% to +5.0% QoQ in CC terms. The near-term macro uncertainties and no meaningful sign of recovery in discretionary IT spending are key concerns for large-cap names; however, we expect mid-tier players to continue their outperformance. Margins for the sector are likely to remain largely range-bound. The benefits from deferring wage hikes and benign currency movements could be offset by the ongoing challenge of recovering lost volumes. The first quarter is also anticipated to be affected by visa costs, leading to a slightly negative bias for the quarter. We believe FY25 will be a year of restrained wage hikes across the industry. Moreover, given the gradual nature of demand recovery, companies can adopt a more cautious approach towards their hiring strategies. This should lead to better margin defense for the sector. Given its size, order book and exposure to long-duration orders and portfolio, TCS is well positioned to withstand the weakening macro environment and ride on the anticipated industry growth. Owing to its steadfast market leadership position and best-in-class execution, the company has been able to maintain its industry-leading margin and demonstrate superior return ratios. The pent-up demand in BFSI should drive growth over the near and medium term. Among Tier-II players, Cyient is poised for robust performance. This will be supported by the revival in the aerospace vertical, the moderating challenges in sectors such as railways and communications, and a strong portfolio in its sustainability business. Additionally, the macro recovery should contribute incrementally to its overall growth in FY25E/FY26E.',

In the past one month, the stock of telecom service provider for Indian Railways has rallied 47 per cent after winning multiple orders worth Rs 161 crore. In the past one year, the stock price of RailTel has zoomed 342 per cent, as compared to 23 per cent rise in the BSE Sensex.    At 01:21 pm; RailTel was trading 16 per cent higher at Rs 603, as against 1 per cent gain on the BSE benchmark index. The average trading volumes at the counter nearly doubled. A combined 58.18 million shares changed hands on the NSE and BSE. Railte is a Miniratna (category-I) PSU, which owns a pan-India fibre optic network, providing broadband and multimedia services, along with modernisation and maintenance of the communications network of the Indian Railways. The company now also offers services to other private and government clients as well. It has two main lines of business - telecom and projects. Under telecom services, it provides lease line services NLD, internet services (ISP) and passive infrastructure services (IP-1). Under the project segment, the company gains from its expertise to lay and maintain OFC networks for other entities. The company owns\xa0 ~61,000 km of optical fibre network to provide long-distance\xa0 services, including\xa0 internet and\xa0 passive\xa0 infrastructure services, across\xa0 the\xa0 country. In addition, it executed critical\xa0 projects of\xa0 national\xa0 importance\xa0 such\xa0 as\xa0 BharatNet,\xa0 National Knowledge Network (NKN), railway signalling, among others.

The budgetary allocation towards railway projects has been increased to Rs 2.55 trillion for 2024-25 from Rs 2.40 trillion in the previous year. For fiscal 2024 (FY24), the company had posted a healthy 30.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) growth in profit after tax at Rs 246.21 crore.

      'article_text': 'HDFC Bank shares on Friday fell sharply after the private lender posted a quarter-on-quarter (Q0Q) decline in loans disbursed in the first quarter of the ongoing financial year (2024-25). The stock slipped 4.55 per cent to settle at Rs 1,648.10. At this price, it has fallen 8.03 per cent from its 52-week high of Rs 1,791.90, a level seen a couple of sessions earlier on July 3. In the April-June quarter (Q1 FY25), gross advances dipped 0.8 per cent sequentially to 24.87 lakh crore. The drop in loan growth was due to a 5 per cent QoQ decline in corporate loans. The bank\'s deposits stood at Rs 23.79 lakh crore in the June quarter, nearly flat from the previous quarter. Low-cost current and savings account deposits fell 5 per cent, sequentially, to Rs 8.64 lakh crore in the quarter. Loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR), a metric to assess whether a lender has enough deposits to fund loan growth, was flat at 105 per cent compared with the prior quarter. These are provisional figures and the bank is scheduled to announce its financial results on July 20. Looking at the lender\'s business update, we\'ve maintained a stance that numbers are only going to improve gradually, Mayuresh Joshi, Head-Equity Research at William O\'Neil India, told . "The stock has moved significantly in the last few months. So, investors can look at it at lower levels. The stock will go through a phase of consolidation till numbers show improvement. And, the figures will start showing some element of respite by the second half of this financial year," Joshi stated. On technical setup, a few analysts said support on the counter could be seen at Rs 1,590 and resistance may be found at Rs 1,700. With that being said, one of them suggested booking profit in the current Rs 1,630-1,660 zone. "The stock has near-term support at Rs 1,590 level. It is expected to recover once a stability is confirmed near the Rs 1,590 zone and thereafter regain strength to carry on with the upward move. A decisive breach below Rs 1,530 would weaken the overall trend," said Shiju Koothupalakkal, Technical Research Analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. "HDFC Bank\'s stock has encountered strong resistance around Rs 1,700 level. We advise traders to avoid initiating fresh positions at current market price," said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. Those holding can book profits in the current Rs 1,630-1,660 range, Patel added.',

      'article_text': 'On Tuesday, Nifty 50 hit a new all-time high of 24,429.15 indicating that the markets are in a strong bullish trend. However, the very next trading session saw Nifty giving up 1.2% gains intra-day. India’s biggest yearly event Budget is on July 23 and there is a lot of volatility surrounding it in the market. One basic question is how do you play the markets? Should you book profit or be a fence sitter now? Here are some key levels to watch out for and an analysis of the trend so far: According to experts, if settles above the mark of 24,400 then it is expected to move towards 24,600 and 24,800 even before the Budget. However, a strong resistance will follow at the mark of 25,000. With a similar approach, Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Research at Religare Broking said that a positive trend may continue until Nifty breaks the 23800 level, any upmove above 24,500 can take Nifty to a new milestone i.e. 25000. However, on the downside, if the index falls below 24,000, it could correct to 23,600 and 23,400, said Mandar Bhojane Equity Research Analyst at Choice Broking. Giving an extreme scenario, Anand James, Chief Strategist at said that Nifty and Sensex have room for upside till 24720/860 and 80860/81650 respectively with the present move, while their downside marker may be placed at 21160/79890, respectively. “For Sensex, the immediate hurdle is placed at 80,400. If Sensex closes decisively above this level on a daily scale, the next targets are 81,800–82,000. Support for Sensex is at 79,000, with 78,400 (21 DEMA) being the next support level if breached,” said Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager and Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. The RSI is at 73.60, indicating that the current bullish trend is likely to continue ahead. According to Bhojane, it suggests that a further 1-2% rally is possible until the budget. Post- , Nifty has gained around 3,119 points (14.6%). However, cautioning investors Mishra of Religare said that the indicators are showing slightly overbought positions which is causing time-wise correction in the indices. Most technical indicators are pointing towards a bullish trajectory. The Nifty50 and the Sensex are trading above their short-term moving averages, specifically the 10-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs). Additionally, the MACD indicator is also displaying a positive trajectory, said Vishnu Kant Upadhyay, Assistant Vice President of Research and Advisory at Master Capital Services. Also, the FIIs’ long-short ratio in index futures has surged to 84%, the highest in months, indicating a heavy leaning towards bullish positions and potential for significant profit booking. “Traders are advised to close their short-term and long positions to capitalize on these gains,” said Patel. This time, markets are approaching the budget with VIX near the 30-day low, a 57% decline from the peak volatility seen after the election result announcement. While the low VIX points towards a low volatility expectation, the risk is always on the upside for the VIX, which is further amplified by cues from the US expected shortly by way of inflation figures, Powell’s testimony etc. As is, Nifty’s range expectation, as projected by VIX is 25340-23440 for the next 30 days, which might widen by another percentage in the run-up to budget day, said James. “To defend against volatility, a strategy of buying on dips at 23,700 and 23,600 is recommended if the index drops below 24,000,” Bhojane added. Investors can rely on the same old method, focusing towards defensive sectors like and pharma can provide stability in a highly volatile market. With a different approach, Patel of Anand Rathi suggests that if the index surpasses 24,500, the rally could extend to higher levels. However, it is prudent to book full profits in this scenario to mitigate the risks associated with the current bullish extremities in the market. Over the years, the budget has ceased to be a day for knee-jerk reactions. Nevertheless, the run-up to the budget day is prone to episodes of some knee-jerk reactions, as markets cannot remain unaffected by speculations.',

      'article_text': 'Credit/debit card charges are levied by the banks on their customers based on the type of card opted for and number of transactions. However, you might have noticed that State Bank of India (SBI) has debited Rs 147.5 from your bank account without you making any transaction. This amount has been deducted from your account under the annual maintenance/service fee for the debit/ATM card used by you. The SBI provides a host of debit cards to its customers and most of them are Classic/Silver/ Contactless/Global debit cards. An amount of Rs 125 is charged by the bank as an annual maintenance fee for these cards. While the charge is Rs 125, SBI deducted Rs 147.5 from your account because a Goods and Services Tax (GST) of 18 per cent is applied on this service fee. Hence, 18 per cent of Rs 125 amounts to Rs 22.5. So, Rs 22.5 is added to Rs 125, resulting in Rs 147.5. Additionally, if you wish to replace or change your debit card, then the bank will levy Rs 300+GST for this service, apart from the service charge. Several types of debit cards are offered by SBI like domestic, international, and co-branded cards. You can apply for a SBI debit card on the basis of your spending requirements. All the debit cards offered by SBI are linked to your bank account, and when you do a transaction via your debit card, the money is deducted directly from your bank account. It’s not just the SBI which charges an annual maintenance fee for the debit/ATM card. Other banks also deduct an annual service fee from their customers’ account. For instance, ICICI Bank charges a joining fee of Rs 499 and an annual charge of the same amount for Coral debit cards. This fee is not charged by the bank for other debit cards. Moreover, ICICI Bank charges Rs 25 for the regeneration of a debit card PIN. This fee is not applied on the requests made via “instapin” at its branches or via customer care using IVR. ICICI Bank debit card holders are charged Rs 25 per transaction for any transaction decline at other bank ATMs or points of sale (PoS) because of insufficient balance in the account.',

      'article_text': 'Cochin Shipyard once again hit a new high at Rs 2,924 on Friday, up by nearly 7.5 per cent. Interestingly, the rally witnessed in the multibagger defence stock comes at a time when the broader market was experiencing a correction after consecutive bull run. While BSE Sensex surpassed the 80k psychological level, NSE nifty touched the 24,400 mark. On a year-to-date basis, Cochin Shipyard has delivered a robust 316 per cent return on the National Stock Exchange. Despite these massive gains, the stock\'s lofty PE ratio of 95—the highest in the industry—raises eyebrows, especially when compared to peers like Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders and Garden Reach. Industry-wise, the overall outlook of defence sector seems buoyed by positive winds, as the shipping ministry is set to launch a new shipbuilding and repair policy under the 100-day action plan of Maritime India Vision 2030, according to a PTI report. As Cochin Shipyard continues to break records in the green territory, investors are left pondering the looming question, how much is too much for this soaring stock? The company saw a 61 per cent surge in its consolidated revenue figure from Rs 2571.57 crore in FY23 to Rs 4140.63 crore in FY24, as per their investor presentation. Whereas, PAT (Profit after tax) stood at Rs 1070.94 crore, up by nearly 155 per cent from Rs 418.44 recorded in FY23. Notably, the company was able to decrease its net debt massively from Rs 132 crore to just Rs 23 crore in the last financial year. As per a report by ICICI Direct, the ship manufacturer also has a strong pipeline in both defence and commercial shipbuilding space, including repair and exports. Around Rs 9,000 crore worth of shipbuilding contracts are expected to be tendered in the medium term, with an additional Rs 84,000 crore in the request for proposal (RFP) stage. In the defence segment, the Indian Navy\'s future warship procurement plans present massive opportunities for Cochin Shipyard, including a potential Rs 40,000 crore order for another aircraft carrier. The defence sector has altogether witnessed a bull run. While Mazagon Dock has seen a staggering 146 per cent surge year-to-date, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers have delivered a strong 209 per cent return on the National Stock Exchange. However, despite their robust market caps many defence companies have lower free-float, which could impact liquidity. In a recent announcement, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh highlighted India’s unprecedented growth in defence production. "India has registered the highest ever growth in the value of defence production in 2023-24. The value of production has reached to Rs. 1,26,887 crore in 2023-24 which is 16.8 per cent higher than the value of production of previous financial year," Singh said in a social media post. The Make in India programme is crossing new milestones, year after year, under the leadership of PM Shri . India has registered the highest ever growth in the value of defence production in 2023-24. The value of production has reached to Rs. 1,26,887 crore in… "The current valuation of Cochin Shipyard is high, indicating that the stock might be overvalued at present levels," Dr. Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking Ltd said.',

      'article_text': 'remains a top pick in the Consumer Goods sector for Emkay Global due to its diversified portfolio and strong execution. The company’s focus on rural growth remains firm, with distribution expansion showing robust progress. Dabur’s strategy of expanding the Total Addressable Market (TAM) across brands with well-supported category extensions through distribution and marketing continues to yield positive results. Emkay Global maintains a BUY rating on Dabur, with a target price of ₹700 per share by June 2025, based on a 46x P/E multiple. The brokerage expects Dabur to achieve a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10% in sales and 15 per cent in earnings over FY24-27. Dabur’s topline is expected to grow by 6%, with mid-single-digit volume growth in domestic operations. Gross margin is anticipated to expand by 90 basis points year-on-year (YoY) to 47.5 per cent. EBITDA expansion is expected to be limited to 20 basis points YoY, reaching 19.5%, due to increased spending on advertising and promotion (A&P), which is projected to rise by 18 per cent. DART has a slightly different take on Dabur’s performance. On a consolidated basis, DART assumes approximately 7% revenue growth, aligning with the company’s guidance. Margins are expected to improve YoY to 19.6 per cent. At the current market price, the stock is trading at 43x FY26E EPS. DART currently holds an “Accumulate” rating on Dabur. Both Emkay Global and DART highlight Dabur’s strong position in the Consumer Goods sector, with particular emphasis on rural growth and strategic category extensions. While Emkay Global projects robust long-term growth with a BUY rating, DART provides a more conservative outlook with an accumulate rating, acknowledging steady revenue growth and margin improvements.',

The Fed decision tonight and the interim Budget tomorrow will weigh on markets in the near-term, says V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services. Global markets will be keenly watching the Fed comment on the timeline and quantum of rate cuts. The first rate cut is likely to come in June 2024. The decline in the 10-year yield to 4.02% is positive since it will restrain FPI outflows, he said. The domestic market will be focused on the interim Budget particularly on any proposals regarding taxation of investments relating to the capital market. The fiscal deficit and its glide path also is important since growth with stability is hugely important from the market perspective, he said. Stock specific movements are likely in response to sectoral allocations in the Budget, he added.",
